Aggregation
        If a class has an entity reference it is known as Aggregation.

example

    class Emp{
    int id;
    String name;
    Address address // here Address  is a class.
    }

Why we use Aggregation ?
    Code Reusability.


when we use Aggregation
       Code reuse is also best achieved by Aggregation when there is no is-a relationship.
       Instance should only be used id the relationship is is-a is maintained throughout the
        lifeline of object invoked. otherwise, aggregation is the best choice.
