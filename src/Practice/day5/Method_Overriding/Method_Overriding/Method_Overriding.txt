Method Overriding
    If a sub-class have same methods as parent class it is known as Method Overriding.

Uses of Method Overriding
    Used to provide a specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its super-class.
    To achieve runtime polymorphism.


Rules of Method Overriding
    method must have same name as parent-class.
    must have same parameters as parent-class.
    there must be a IS-A relationship(Inheritance).

-> Example 1

Can we override static methods?
No, Static methods cannot be overridden. It can be proved by runtime polymorphism.

Why can't we override static methods?
    It is because static methods is bound with the class whereas instance method is bound with object.
    static belongs to class area and an instance belong to heap area.
