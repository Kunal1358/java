Java throws keyword
    The Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception. It gives an information to the programmer
    that there may occur an exception so it is better for the programmer to provide
    the exception handling code so that normal flow can be maintained.


Syntax of java throws
    return_type method_name() throws exception_class_name{
    //method code
    }

--> code1


Advantage of Java throws keyword
    Now Checked Exception can be propagated (forwarded in call stack).
    It provides information to the caller of the method about the exception.

--> code2

** If you are calling a method that declares an exception, you must either caught or declare the exception  **

--> Code3

You declare the exception
    A)In case you declare the exception, if exception does not occur, the code will be executed fine.
    B)In case you declare the exception if exception occures, an exception will be thrown at
    runtime because throws does not handle the exception.

--> code5

Java throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.            |        	    Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception.
2)	Checked exception cannot be propagated using throw only.            | 	            Checked exception can be propagated with throws.
3)	Throw is followed by an instance.	                                |               Throws is followed by class.
4)	Throw is used within the method.                                    |               Throws is used with the method signature.
5)	You cannot throw multiple exceptions.                               |               You can declare multiple exceptions e.g.
                                                                        |               public void method()throws IOException,SQLException.
                                                                        |
