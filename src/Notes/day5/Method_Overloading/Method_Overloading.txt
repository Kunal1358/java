Method Overloading
        If a class have multiple methods having same methods with different parameters.
        it is known as Method Overloading.

If we have to perform only one operation, having same name of the method increases the
    reusablility of code.


Advantage of Method Overloading
    Increases the readability of code.

Ways to Overload method
    By changing no of argument -> Example1
    By changing dataType -> Example2

** In Java Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of method only. **


Why Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of method only?
    Only because of ambiguity. Compiler get confused which method should be called
    It will give compile time error

Can we overload main method?
    yes we can but main() method with string array as argument only get called.
