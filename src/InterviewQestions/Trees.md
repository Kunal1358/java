# Trees

>## What is a tree?
>> A Tree is a non-linear data structure where data objects are generally organized in terms of hierarchical relationship.  
 The structure is non-linear in the sense that, unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and Queues, data in a tree is not organized linearly.

> ## What is a Binary Tree 
 >>The Binary tree is a tree that can have maximum two children at each node.

> ## Different Type of Trees
 >> Full binary tree: Every node other than leaf nodes has 2 child nodes.
  >
>> Complete binary tree: All levels are filled except possibly the last one, and all nodes are filled in as far left as possible.
>
>> Perfect binary tree: All nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.

> ## What is Binary Heap?
>> Itâ€™s a complete tree . This property of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.
>
>>A Binary Heap is either <B>Min Heap</B> or <B>Max Heap</B>. In a Min Binary Heap, the key at root must be minimum among all keys present in Binary Heap. The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree. Max Binary Heap is similar to MinHeap.
