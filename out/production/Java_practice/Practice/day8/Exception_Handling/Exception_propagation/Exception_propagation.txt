Exception propagation
    An exception is first thrown from the top of the stack and if it is not caught, it drops down
    the call stack to previous method, If not caught there the exception again drops to the previous
    method, So on until they are caught or they reach very bottom of the call stack. This is called
    Exception propagation.

** By default Unchecked Exceptions are forwarded in calling chain (propagated)  **
