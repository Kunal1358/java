Scanner ->
            Scanner class is found in java.util package.
             Java provides various ways to read input from the keyboard, the java.util.Scanner class is one of them.

             The Java Scanner class breaks the input into tokens using a delimiter which is whitespace by default.
              It provides many methods to read and parse various primitive values.

To get the instance of Java Scanner which reads input from the user, we need to pass the input stream (System.in)
 in the constructor of Scanner class. For Example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);



Method	        Description
nextInt()	    reads an int value from the user
nextFloat()	    reads a float value form the user
nextBoolean()	reads a boolean value from the user
nextLine()	    reads a line of text from the user
next()	        reads a word from the user
nextByte()	    reads a byte value from the user
nextDouble()	reads a double value from the user
nextShort()	    reads a short value from the user
nextLong()	    reads a long value from the user

sc.next().charAt(0) -> Used to read single value like M or F.


Why string inputs after integer input gets skipped in Java?


This is a common problem, and it happens because the nextInt method doesn't read
 the newline character of your input, so when you issue the command nextLine, the Scanner
  finds the newline character and gives you that as a line.
