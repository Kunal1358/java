Arrays
        Arrays is a collection of items stored in contiguous memory locations.
        Idea is to store multiple items of the same data-type together.


In java array are dynamically allocated.
Arrays are object in java so we can find their length by using the object property length.
Array index starts from 0.
The direct superclass of an array type is object.


10 20 30 40 50 60

Array.length=6
Array[0]=10
Array[5]=60


One-Dimensional Arrays :

declaration->

type array[];
    or
type [] array;



int array[];

Although the first declaration above establishes the fact that intArray is an array variable,
no actual array exists. It merely tells the compiler that this variable (intArray) will hold
an array of the integer type. To link intArray with an actual, physical array of integers, you must
allocate one using new and assign it to intArray.


When an array is declared, only a reference of array is created.
To actually create or give memory to array, you create an array like this

type array-name[] = new type[size];

you can do like this also

int array[];
array[]=new int [size];

          or

int array[]=new int[size];


When an array is initialized it will automatically assign
    0 to int array
    false to boolean;
    null for reference type



Array Literal

In a situation, where the size of the array and variables of array are already known, array literals can be used.


int array[]=new int[]{1,2,3,5,2,26,6,3,6,553};

Code 1
Code 2

What happens if we try to access element outside the array size?

JVM throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException to indicate that array has been accessed with an illegal index.
The index is either negative or greater than or equal to size of array.

Its an unchecked exception and comes under runtime exception.


Multidimensional Arrays

Multidimensional arrays are arrays of arrays with each element of the array holding the reference of other array.
These are also known as Jagged Arrays.
A multidimensional array is created by appending one set of square brackets ([]) per dimension. Examples:

int[][] intArray = new int[10][20]; //a 2D array or matrix
int[][][] intArray = new int[10][20][10]; //a 3D array


            Time Complexity

Algorithm	    Average Case	Worst Case

Access	        O(1)	        O(1)
Search	        O(n)	        O(n)
Insertion   	O(n)	        O(n)
Deletion	    O(n)	        O(n)


Space Complexity
In array, space complexity for worst case is O(n).
