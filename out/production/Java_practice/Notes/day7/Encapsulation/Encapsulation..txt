Encapsulation
        in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit,
        for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.


Advantages
        to achieve data hiding
        provides control over the data
        By providing only a setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or write-only.
         In other words, you can skip the getter or setter methods.

-->Example1

Read-Only class

//A Java class which has only getter methods.

public class Student{

    //private data member

    private String college="AKG";

    //getter method for college

    public String getCollege(){
        return college;
    }
}



Write-Only class

//A Java class which has only setter methods.

public class Student{
    //private data member

    private String college;

    //getter method for college

    public void setCollege(String college){
        this.college=college;
    }
}
