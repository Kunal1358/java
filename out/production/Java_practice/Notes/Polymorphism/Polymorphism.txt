Polymorphism ->
        Polymorphism in java is as method by which we can perform a single action in different ways
        Poly -> many
        morph -> forms

Types of Polymorphism
    compile-time
    run-time

If you overload a static method it is known as compile-time Polymorphism.

Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is a process in which a
 call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.

Upcasting
    If a reference variable of parent class refer to the object of child class


class A(){

}

class B(){

}

A obj=new B(); // This is called Upcasting
