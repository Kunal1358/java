Interface ->
            Interface in java is a blueprint of class.
            It has static constants and abstract methods.


Uses
    It is used to achieve abstraction.
    By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
    It can be used to achieve loose coupling.

** All fields are public static and final by default **


interface printable{
    void print();
    int n=5;
}

Compiler ->

interface printable{
    public abstract void print();
    public static final int n=5;
}
